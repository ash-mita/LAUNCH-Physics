<p>In physics, we describe motion using vectors and scalars. Vectors have a
	magnitude and direction, while scalars only have a magnitude. The magnitude
	refers to the size of the vector or scalar. Some examples of vectors are
	displacement, acceleration, velocity, and forces, and some examples of
	scalars are mass, distance, and speed. We will cover the definitions of
	these terms later on.</p>
