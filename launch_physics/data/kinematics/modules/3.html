<p>The Kinematic Equations help explain one dimensional motion.</p>
<p>The kinematic equations are the following:</p>

TODO IMAGE

<p>They look complicated, but we will not use these equations in these modules.
	Just know that they are used to describe motion in one dimension. One
	simplified version of a kinematic equation can be used to determine the
	amount of distance an object travels over a period of time in freefall:
	d=1/2gt^2. In this equation, g is the acceleration due to gravity, which is
	-9.8 m/s^2, if the direction of the motion is upward.</p>
<p>Gravity is a very important concept in physics, and we will explore it more
	as we talk more about forces. It is important to note that gravity acts on
	all objects with mass.</p>
