<p>In order to describe the motion of an object, we must first explain the
	amount of distance that it has travelled. Let’s say we have a friend named
	Alice, who starts on a winding road and travels along the road until she
	reaches the end of the road:</p>

<p>The amount of distance that Alice travelled is the length of the blue path,
	while her displacement is represented by the red arrow. Displacement is the
	net change in Alice’s position. Displacement is vector, because it depends
	on the position of an object, and the direction matters.</p>
<p>Velocity is the change in position of an object over time. The speed is the
	magnitude of the velocity, or the size of the velocity vector. Usually the
	speed is associated with the value of the velocity. The equation for
	velocity is given by v = meters/seconds, and the unit for velocity is m/s.</p>
<p>Acceleration is the change in velocity over time of an object. Acceleration
	is essentially the amount that the velocity changes every second. Think
	about a car as it starts to drive. Its velocity increases, which means that
	the car is accelerating.</p>
<p>The amount of distance that an object has travelled does not have anything to
	do with direction.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Displacement - Position of an object</li>
	<li>Velocity - The change in position over time</li>
	<li>Acceleration - The derivative of velocity with respect to time</li>
</ul>
