<p>Motion is all around us! The study of motion is called physics, and before we
	dive into the more complex ideas of physics, we must first explore one
	dimensional motion through kinematics. In this section we will cover:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Scalars and Vectors</li>
	<li>Position, Velocity, Acceleration</li>
	<li>Kinematic Equations</li>
</ul>
